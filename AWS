- OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization of Standardization‘, in the year 1984. 
- It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data 
  from one person to another across the globe.
- Application
  Presentation
  Session
  Transport
  Network
  Data-link
  Physical - (PDNT-SP-A) - (BFDSM)

- The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and 
  communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1) :
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.
The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. 
When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame together.

The functions of the physical layer are :

- Bit synchronization: The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. 
  This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level.
- Bit rate control: The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.
- Physical topologies: Physical layer specifies the way in which the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. bus, star or mesh topolgy.
- Transmission mode: Physical layer also defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected devices. 
  The various transmission modes possible are: Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.
* Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are Physical Layer devices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

2. Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :
The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from 
one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.
Data Link Layer is divided into two sub layers :

- Logical Link Control (LLC)
- Media Access Control (MAC)

DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.
The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the 
destination host will reply with its MAC address.

The functions of the data Link layer are :

- Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. 
  This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.
  
- Physical addressing: After creating frames, Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC address) of sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.

- Error control: Data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.
  The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm is implemented here to detect the errors.   

- Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates that amount of data that can be sent
  before receiving acknowledgement.Basically Flow control means the rate at which the sender is sending should be somewhat sunk with the rate at which receiver 
  can receive and process the data. If a sink is not maintained then the data packets would get lost. 
  These Flow Control also helps in determining the algorithm in which we will repeat the process of sending the lost packets. 

- Access control: When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, MAC sub-layer of data link layer helps to determine which device 
  has control over the channel at a given time.
  
- Packet in Data Link layer is referred as Frame.
- Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines.
- 2-layer Switch, Network Card & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
- Physical Addressing is done over here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

3. Network Layer (Layer 3) :
Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. 
selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by 
the network layer.

The functions of the Network layer are :

- Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of network layer is known as routing.
- Logical Addressing: In order to identify each device on internetwork uniquely, network layer defines an addressing scheme. 
  The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by network layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.

- Segment in Network layer is referred as Packet/Datagram.
- Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers,3-layer switches.
- Protocol used is IP.
- Logical Addressing is done over here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) :
Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes services from network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. 
It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission 
and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

• At sender’s side:
Transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Segmentation and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data 
transmission. It also adds Source and Destination port number in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer.

Note: The sender need to know the port number associated with the receiver’s application.

Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually. For example, when a web application makes a request to a web server, 
it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications. Many applications have default port assigned.

• At receiver’s side:
Transport Layer reads the port number from its header and forwards the Data which it has received to the respective application. It also performs sequencing and 
reassembling of the segmented data.

The functions of the transport layer are :

- Segmentation and Reassembly: This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer , breaks the message into smaller units . 
  Each of the segment produced has a header associated with it. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.
  
- Service Point Addressing: In order to deliver the message to correct process, transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address 
  or port address. Thus by specifying this address, transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.

- Flow Control

- Error Control

- Connection Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process which include
  – Connection Establishment
  – Data Transfer
  – Termination / disconnection
  In this type of transmission, the receiving device sends an acknowledgement, back to the source after a packet or group of packet is received. 
  This type of transmission is reliable and secure.
  
- Connection less service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer. In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a 
  packet. This approach allows for much faster communication between devices. Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service.

- Data in the Transport Layer is called as Segments.
- Transport layer is operated by the Operating System. It is a part of the OS and communicates with the Application Layer by making system calls.
- Transport Layer is called as Heart of OSI model. Gateways, Firewalls are commonly used srvices of OSI.

- Protocols used are TCP, UDP, SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Session Layer (Layer 5) :
This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.

The functions of the session layer are :

- Session establishment, maintenance and termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use and terminate a connection.
- Synchronization : This layer allows a process to add checkpoints which are considered as synchronization points into the data. 
  These synchronization point help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely and 
  data loss is avoided.
- Authentication
- Authorization 
- All the below 3 layers(including Session Layer) are integrated as a single layer in the TCP/IP model as “Application Layer”.
- Implementation of these 3 layers is done by the network application itself. These are also known as Upper Layers or Software Layers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6) :
Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to 
transmit over the network.

The functions of the presentation layer are :

- Translation : For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
- Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.
- Encryption/ Decryption : Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the cipher text and the 
  decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.

- Protocol used is SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Application Layer (Layer 7) :
At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. 
These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access 
the network and for displaying the received information to the user.
Ex: Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger etc.

- Application Layer is also called as Desktop Layer.

The functions of the Application layer are :

- FTAM - File transfer access and management
- Mail Services
- Directory Services

- A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet, DHCP, IRC (Internet Relay Chat),
  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-layer switch vs 3-layer switch:

- Operate on layer 2 (Data link) of OSI model. Operate on layer 3 (Network Layer) of OSI model.
- Work with MAC address only. Can perform functioning of both 2 layer and 3 layer switch
- Quite fast as they do not look at the Layer 3 portion of the data packets. Takes time to examine data packets before sending them to their destination
- It has single broadcast domain	It has multiple broadcast domain.
- Can communicate within a network only.	Can communicate within or outside network.
