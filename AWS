- OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization of Standardization‘, in the year 1984. 
- It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data 
  from one person to another across the globe.
- Application
  Presentation
  Session
  Transport
  Network
  Data-link
  Physical - (PDNT-SP-A) - (BFDSM)

- The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and 
  communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1) :
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.
The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. 
When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame together.

The functions of the physical layer are :

- Bit synchronization: The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. 
  This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level.
- Bit rate control: The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.
- Physical topologies: Physical layer specifies the way in which the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. bus, star or mesh topolgy.
- Transmission mode: Physical layer also defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected devices. 
  The various transmission modes possible are: Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.
* Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are Physical Layer devices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

2. Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :
The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from 
one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.
Data Link Layer is divided into two sub layers :

- Logical Link Control (LLC)
- Media Access Control (MAC)

DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.
The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the 
destination host will reply with its MAC address.

The functions of the data Link layer are :

- Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. 
  This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.
  
- Physical addressing: After creating frames, Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC address) of sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.

- Error control: Data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.
  The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm is implemented here to detect the errors.   

- Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates that amount of data that can be sent
  before receiving acknowledgement.Basically Flow control means the rate at which the sender is sending should be somewhat sunk with the rate at which receiver 
  can receive and process the data. If a sink is not maintained then the data packets would get lost. 
  These Flow Control also helps in determining the algorithm in which we will repeat the process of sending the lost packets. 

- Access control: When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, MAC sub-layer of data link layer helps to determine which device 
  has control over the channel at a given time.
  
- Packet in Data Link layer is referred as Frame.
- Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines.
- 2-layer Switch, Network Card & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
- Physical Addressing is done over here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

3. Network Layer (Layer 3) :
Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. 
selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by 
the network layer.

The functions of the Network layer are :

- Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of network layer is known as routing.
- Logical Addressing: In order to identify each device on internetwork uniquely, network layer defines an addressing scheme. 
  The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by network layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.

- Segment in Network layer is referred as Packet/Datagram.
- Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers,3-layer switches.
- Protocol used is IP.
- Logical Addressing is done over here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) :
TCP has segments, UDP has datagrams.
Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes services from network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. 
It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission 
and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

• At sender’s side:
Transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Segmentation and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data 
transmission. It also adds Source and Destination port number in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer.

Note: The sender need to know the port number associated with the receiver’s application.

Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually. For example, when a web application makes a request to a web server, 
it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications. Many applications have default port assigned.

• At receiver’s side:
Transport Layer reads the port number from its header and forwards the Data which it has received to the respective application. It also performs sequencing and 
reassembling of the segmented data.

The functions of the transport layer are :

- Segmentation and Reassembly: This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer , breaks the message into smaller units . 
  Each of the segment produced has a header associated with it. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.
  
- Service Point Addressing: In order to deliver the message to correct process, transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address 
  or port address. Thus by specifying this address, transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.

- Flow Control

- Error Control

- Connection Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process which include
  – Connection Establishment
  – Data Transfer
  – Termination / disconnection
  In this type of transmission, the receiving device sends an acknowledgement, back to the source after a packet or group of packet is received. 
  This type of transmission is reliable and secure.
  
- Connection less service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer. In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a 
  packet. This approach allows for much faster communication between devices. Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service.

- Data in the Transport Layer is called as Segments.
- Transport layer is operated by the Operating System. It is a part of the OS and communicates with the Application Layer by making system calls.
- Transport Layer is called as Heart of OSI model. Gateways, Firewalls are commonly used srvices of OSI.

- Protocols used are TCP, UDP, SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Session Layer (Layer 5) :
This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.

The functions of the session layer are :

- Session establishment, maintenance and termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use and terminate a connection.
- Synchronization : This layer allows a process to add checkpoints which are considered as synchronization points into the data. 
  These synchronization point help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely and 
  data loss is avoided.
- Authentication
- Authorization 
- All the below 3 layers(including Session Layer) are integrated as a single layer in the TCP/IP model as “Application Layer”.
- Implementation of these 3 layers is done by the network application itself. These are also known as Upper Layers or Software Layers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6) :
Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to 
transmit over the network.

The functions of the presentation layer are :

- Translation : For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
- Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.
- Encryption/ Decryption : Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the cipher text and the 
  decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.

- Protocol used is SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Application Layer (Layer 7) :
At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. 
These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access 
the network and for displaying the received information to the user.
Ex: Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger etc.

- Application Layer is also called as Desktop Layer.

The functions of the Application layer are :

- FTAM - File transfer access and management
- Mail Services
- Directory Services

- A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet, DHCP, IRC (Internet Relay Chat),
  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-layer switch vs 3-layer switch:

- Operate on layer 2 (Data link) of OSI model. Operate on layer 3 (Network Layer) of OSI model.
- Work with MAC address only. Can perform functioning of both 2 layer and 3 layer switch
- Quite fast as they do not look at the Layer 3 portion of the data packets. Takes time to examine data packets before sending them to their destination
- It has single broadcast domain	It has multiple broadcast domain.
- Can communicate within a network only.	Can communicate within or outside network.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***********
MSS (maximum segment size) - MTU (maximum transmission unit)

- MSS (maximum segment size) limits the size of packets, or small chunks of data, that travel across a network, such as the Internet. 
  All data that travels over a network is broken up into packets. Packets have several headers attached to them that contain information about their contents 
  and destination. MSS measures the non-header portion of a packet, which is called the payload.

- If a data packet is compared to a transport truck, with the header being the truck itself and the payload being the trailer and cargo, then MSS is like 
  a scale that measures only the trailer. If the trailer weighs too much, then the truck is not allowed to continue to its destination.

- More specifically, MSS is the largest TCP (Transport Control Protocol) segment size that a network-connected device can receive. MSS defines "segment" as 
  only the length of the payload, not any attached headers. MSS is measured in bytes.

- MSS is determined by another metric that has to do with packet size: MTU, or the maximum transmission unit, which does include the TCP and IP 
  headers. To continue the analogy, MTU measures the total weight of the truck and its trailer and cargo, instead of just the trailer and cargo.

- Essentially, the MSS is equal to MTU minus the size of a TCP header and an IP header:
  MTU - (TCP header + IP header) = MSS

- One of the key differences between MTU and MSS is that if a packet exceeds a device's MTU, it is broken up into smaller pieces, or "fragmented." 
  In contrast, if a packet exceeds the MSS, it is dropped and not delivered.

- Fragmentation is not permitted in IPv6. IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, although IPv4 is still widely used. Routers that support IPv6 
  will drop any IPv6 packets that exceed the MTU, because they cannot be fragmented.

- Fragmentation is also not possible when the "Don't Fragment" flag is activated in a packet's IP header.

- Incase of IPv4, a Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message is sent back to the router along with its MTU limit, for fragmentation, to help prev router
  to break packages and send again.

- TCP headers are almost always 20 bytes* long. IP headers include information such as the source and destination IP address, and they are also 20 bytes long. 
  Both TCP and IP packets include optional header fields that can make the headers longer, but these are almost never used.

- Suppose a network router has an MTU of 1,500, meaning it only accepts packets up to 1,500 bytes long. (Longer packets will be fragmented.) 
  What should the MSS for the router be set to? MTU - (TCP header + IP header) = MSS
  1,500 - (20 + 20) = 1,460

- The router’s MSS should be set to 1,460 bytes. Packets with a payload size larger than 1,460 bytes will be dropped. 
  (A device could send an overly large packet like this by mistake if it is not aware of the MTU and MSS settings of the routers in between it and another device.
  A process called path MTU discovery helps avoid such incidents.)

- MSS is a layer 4, or transport layer, metric. It is used with TCP, a transport layer protocol. However, it is closely related to MTU, which applies to layer 3 
  (the network layer).

- Occasionally, a router along a network path has an MTU value set lower than the typical 1,500 bytes. This can result in packet loss and can be difficult to 
  discover. To ensure packets still reach their destination in this situation, one option is to reduce the size of incoming packet payloads. 
  This can be achieved by configuring the server to apply an MSS clamp: during the TCP handshake, the server can signal the MSS for packets it is willing 
  to receive, "clamping" the maximum payload size from the other server. 

- Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is a standardized technique in computer networking for determining the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on the network path 
  between two Internet Protocol (IP) hosts, usually with the goal of avoiding IP fragmentation.

- TCP MSS is sent inside SYN packet of a receiver during the 3-way-handshake process of establishing TCP connection in a way that the host on the other side can 
  know how much payload he is allowed to put into frames when sending to him in order to avoid fragmentation.

Router - Switch

* Switch is a multiport bridge.
- A Data-link layer device.
- It inspects the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and send it to it; 
- Eliminates collision domain, but broadcast domain remains same.

         and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. 
	        It has a single input and single output port, thus making it a 2 port device.

* Hubs and Switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network , usually referred to as LAN (Local Area Network);

3. Routers
------------
- Router - A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks;
- It operates at the 3rd layer - Network Layer;
- A router detemines the IP address to determine where to send the data;
- Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between lots of different networks in the world;

- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets trhem to learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*********
Broadcast Domain:

Collision Domain –
- A Collision Domain is a scenario in which when a device sends out a message to the network, all other devices which are included in its collision domain have 
  to pay attention to it, no matter if it was destined for them or not. This causes a problem because, in a situation where two devices send out their messages 
  simultaneously, a collision will occur leading them to wait and re-transmit their respective messages, one at a time. 
- Remember, it happens only in case of a half-duplex mode.

Broadcast Domain –
- A Broadcast Domain is a scenario in which when a device sends out a broadcast message, all the devices present in its broadcast domain have to pay attention 
  to it. This creates a lot of congestion in the network, commonly called LAN congestion, which affects the bandwidth of the users present in that network.

- From this, we can realize that more the number of collision domains and more the number of broadcast domains, the more efficient is the network providing 
  better bandwidth to all its users.

- HUB:
  We start with a hub because we should get rid of it as soon as possible. The reason being, it neither breaks a collision domain nor a broadcast domain,
  i.e a hub is neither a collision domain separator nor a broadcast domain separator. All the devices connected to a hub is in a single collision and single 
  broadcast domain. Remember, hubs do not segment a network, they just connect network segments.

- SWITCH:
  Coming to switches, we have an advantage over the hub. Every port on a switch is in a different collision domain, i.e a switch is a collision domain separator.
  So messages that come from devices connected to different ports never experience a collision. This helps us during designing networks but there is still a 
  problem with switches. They never break broadcast domains, means it is not a broadcast domain separator. 
  All the ports on the switch are in still in a single broadcast domain. If a device sends a broadcast message, it will still cause congestion.

- ROUTER:
  Last, but not least, we have our savior. A router not only breaks collision domains but also break broadcast domains, means it is both collision as well as 
  broadcast domain separator. A router creates a connection between two networks. A broadcast message from one network will never reach the other one as the 
  router will never let it pass.

- Also, as repeaters and bridges differ from hubs and switches only in terms of the number of ports, a repeater does not break collision and broadcast domains, 
  while a bridge breaks only collision domains.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
******************
TCP/UDP


- What is TCP?
- TCP/IP helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how you can transmit data between them. 
  TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. It is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte 
  stream over an unreliable internetwork.

- What is UDP?
- UDP is a Datagram oriented protocol. It is used for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission. The full form of UDP is User Datagram Protocol 
  (A datagram is a transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network.) The UDP protocol works almost similar to TCP, but it throws all the error-checking 
  stuff out, all the back-and-forth communication and deliverability.
  
- How TCP work?
- A TCP connection is established with the help of three-way handshake. It is a process of initiating and acknowledging a connection. Once the connection is 
  established, data transfer begins, and when the transmission process is finished, the connection is terminated by the closing of an established virtual circuit.

- How UDP work?
- UDP uses a simple transmission method without implied hand-shaking dialogues for ordering, reliability, or data integrity. UDP also assumes that error checking 
  and correction is not important or performed in the application, to avoid the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. 

- Features of TCP

	- Delivery Acknowledgements
	- Re transmission
	- Easy Error detection
	/ You can't use for broadcast or multicast transmission.
	/ TCP offers many features that you don't want. It may waste bandwidth, time, or effort.

- Feature of UDP:

	- Supports bandwidth-intensive applications that tolerate packet loss
	- Less delay
	- It sends the bulk quantity of packets.
 	/ In UDP protocol, a packet may not be delivered or delivered twice. 
	/ It may be delivered out of order, so you get no indication

- A short example to understand the differences clearly :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Examples for TCP/UDP: 

- Suppose there are two houses, H1 and H2 and a letter have to be sent from H1 to H2. But there is a river in between those two houses. 
  Now how can we send the letter?
/ Solution 1: Make a bridge over the river and then it can it delivered. - TCP.
/ Solution 2: Get it delivered through a pigeon. - UDP.

- Email: TCP
/ Reason: suppose if some packet(words/statement) is missing we cannot understand the content.It should be reliable.
  
- Stock Updates, Video streaming: UDP
/ Reason: Suppose if some packet(frame/sequence) is missing we can understand the content.Because video is collection of frames.For 1 second video there should 
  be 25 frames(image).Even though we can understand some frames are missing due to our imagination skills. Thats why UDP is used for video streaming.
  
- TCP is mailing a letter at the post office with return address and postman will make sure to deliver letters in order and in time.

- UDP is just mailing the letter at the post office .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data 
  and should close the connection after transmitting the data.	
- UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. 
  UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission.

- TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router.	
- The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.

- TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.	
- UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.

- Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver.	
- There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.

- UDP is used by DNS, DHCP, (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) TFTP, and VoIP, Online multiplayer games.
- TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP and Telnet.

- TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.	
- UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP.

- Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP.	
- There is no retransmission of lost packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

- TCP has a (20-80) bytes variable length header.	
- UDP has a 8 bytes fixed length header.

- TCP is heavy-weight.	
- UDP is lightweight.

- TCP doesn’t supports Broadcasting.	
- UDP supports Broadcasting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
******
Flow Control: Flow control coordinates that amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement.

- It is one of the most important duties of the data link layer.
- Flow control tells the sender how much data to send.
- It makes the sender wait for some sort of an acknowledgement (ACK) before continuing to send more data.
- Flow Control Techniques: Stop-and-wait, and Sliding Window

- Feedback based Flow Control In these protocols, the sender sends frames after it has received acknowledgments from the user. This is used in the network layer.
- Rate based Flow Control These protocols have built in mechanisms to restrict the rate of transmission of data without requiring acknowledgment from the receiver. 
  This is used in the network layer and the transport layer.

1.) Stop and Wait Flow control:
- The sender has to wait for an acknowledgment of every frame that it sends.
- Only when a acknowledgment has been received is the next frame sent. This process continues until the sender transmits an End of Transmission (EOT) frame.
- In Stop-and-Wait flow control, the receiver indicates its readiness to receive data for each frame.
- For every frame that is sent, there needs to be an acknowledgment, which takes a similar amount of propagation time to get back to the sender.
- Only one frame can be in transmission at a time. This leads to inefficiency if propagation delay is much longer than the transmission delay
- Features of Stop and Wait:
  - It's simple and each frame is checked and acknowledged well.
  / Only one frame can be in transmission at a time.
  / It is inefficient, if the distance between devices is long. Reason is propagation delay is much longer than the transmission delay.
  / The time spent for waiting acknowledgements between each frame can add significant amount to the total transmission time.

2.) Sliding Window
- This protocol improves the efficiency of stop and wait protocol by allowing multiple frames to be transmitted before receiving an acknowledgment.
- Both the sender and the receiver has finite sized buffers called windows. The sender and the receiver agrees upon the number of frames to be sent based upon 
  the buffer size.
- The sender sends multiple frames in a sequence, without waiting for acknowledgment. When its sending window is filled, it waits for acknowledgment. 
  On receiving acknowledgment, it advances the window and transmits the next frames, according to the number of acknowledgments received.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
******
Error Control:
- Error control in data link layer is the process of detecting and correcting data frames that have been corrupted or lost during transmission.
- In case of lost or corrupted frames, the receiver does not receive the correct data-frame and sender is ignorant about the loss. Data link layer follows a 
  technique to detect transit errors and take necessary actions, which is retransmission of frames whenever error is detected or frame is lost. 
  The process is called Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ).

- Phases in Error Control

1. Detection of Error − Transmission error, if any, is detected by either the sender or the receiver.

2. Acknowledgment − acknowledgment may be positive or negative.

- Positive ACK − On receiving a correct frame, the receiver sends a positive acknowledge.

- Negative ACK − On receiving a damaged frame or a duplicate frame, the receiver sends a negative acknowledgment back to the sender.

3. Retransmission − The sender maintains a clock and sets a timeout period. If an acknowledgment of a data-frame previously transmitted does not arrive 
   before the timeout, or a negative acknowledgment is received, the sender retransmits the frame.


- Basic approach used for error detection - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/
  1. Simple Parity check
  2. Checksum
  3. Cyclic redundancy check

1. Simple Parity check
-  Blocks of data from the source are subjected to a check bit or parity bit generator form, where a parity of :

- 1 is added to the block if it contains odd number of 1’s, and
- 0 is added if it contains even number of 1’s
- This scheme makes the total number of 1’s even, that is why it is called even parity checking. If even ones are found, then okay, else not.

2. Checksum

- In checksum error detection scheme, the data is divided into k segments each of m bits.
- In the sender’s end the segments are added using 1’s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented to get the checksum.
- The checksum segment is sent along with the data segments.
- At the receiver’s end, all received segments are added using 1’s complement arithmetic to get the sum. 
- The sum is added with the checksum using 1s complement, then complemented.
- If the result is zero, the received data is accepted; otherwise discarded.
/ If noise modify the data in such a way that vertically placed bits can cancel the change made to them then calculated checksum will always be same as received 
  checksum. Such errors cannot be detected and they are known as vertical errors.

3. Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

- Unlike checksum scheme, which is based on addition, CRC is based on binary division.
- In CRC, a sequence of redundant bits, called cyclic redundancy check bits, are appended to the end of data unit so that the resulting data unit becomes 
  exactly divisible by a second, predetermined binary number.
- At the destination, the incoming data unit is divided by the same number. If at this step there is no remainder, the data unit is assumed to be correct 
  and is therefore accepted.
- A remainder indicates that the data unit has been damaged in transit and therefore must be rejected.

******
Error Correction: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/error-control-in-data-link-layer
1. Stop and Wait ARQ
2. Go-Back-N ARQ
3. Selective Repeat ARQ

1. Stop and Wait ARQ
- A timeout counter is maintained by the sender, which is started when a frame is sent.
- If the sender receives acknowledgment of the sent frame within time, the sender is confirmed about successful delivery of the frame. It then transmits the next
  frame in queue.
- If the sender does not receive the acknowledgment within time, the sender assumes that either the frame or its acknowledgment is lost in transit. 
  It then retransmits the frame.
- If the sender receives a negative acknowledgment, the sender retransmits the frame.

2. Go-Back-N ARQ
- The sender has buffers called sending window.
- The sender sends multiple frames based upon the sending-window size, without receiving the acknowledgment of the previous ones.
- The receiver receives frames one by one. It keeps track of incoming frame’s sequence number and sends the corresponding acknowledgment frames.
- After the sender has sent all the frames in window, it checks up to what sequence number it has received positive acknowledgment.
- If the sender has received positive acknowledgment for all the frames, it sends next set of frames.
- If sender receives NACK or has not receive any ACK for a particular frame, it retransmits all the frames after which it does not receive any positive ACK.

3. Selective Repeat ARQ

- Both the sender and the receiver have buffers called sending window and receiving window respectively.
- The sender sends multiple frames based upon the sending-window size, without receiving the acknowledgment of the previous ones.
- The receiver also receives multiple frames within the receiving window size.
- The receiver keeps track of incoming frame’s sequence numbers, buffers the frames in memory.
- It sends ACK for all successfully received frames and sends NACK for only frames which are missing or damaged.
- The sender in this case, sends only packet for which NACK is received.
	
1.	In Go-Back-N Protocol, if the sent frame are find suspected then all the frames are re-transmitted from the lost packet to the last packet transmitted.	
   	In selective Repeat protocol, only those frames are re-transmitted which are found suspected.
2.	Sender window size of Go-Back-N Protocol is N.	
	Sender window size of selective Repeat protocol is also N.
3.	Receiver window size of Go-Back-N Protocol is 1.	
	Receiver window size of selective Repeat protocol is N.
4.	In Go-Back-N Protocol, type of Acknowledgement is cumulative.	
	In selective Repeat protocol, type of Acknowledgement is individual.
5.	In Go-Back-N Protocol, if Receiver receives a corrupt packet, then also, the entire window is re-transmitted.	
	In selective Repeat protocol, if Receives receives a corrupt packet, it immediately sends a negative acknowledgement and 
	hence only the selective packet is retransmitted.
