* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
----------------------------------------
- Every coputer on a mordern TCP/IP network needs to have 4 thing configured:
1. IP address
2. Subnet mask for the local network
3. Gateway
4. Name server

- Configuring 100s of them is a tedious task -  Subnet mask for the local network, Gateway, Name server are almost the same for the nodes on a network;
- IP address needs to be different on every node on the network;
- This is where DHCP is important;

* DHCP - An application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network;
    - With DHCP a machine queries a DHCP server when the computer connects to the network and receives all the network configurations in one go;
    - For Gateways and routers static IP address are important and need to be known to all clients on the network;
    
* DHCP ways of operation:
--------------------------
1. Dynamic allocation - A range of IP addresses are set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they 
   request one;  There the IP of a system can be different everytime it connects to the network;

2. Automatic allocation - A range of IP addresses are set aside for assignmnet purpose; Here the DHCP tracks the assignment numbers 
   assigned to a host device and ensures to assign the same IP to the same machine;

3. Fixed allocation - Requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs; MAC address and IP addressing mapping 
   and lookup; If the MAC address is not available the DHCP server will fall back to automatic or dynamic allocation; 
   It can act as a great security measure that only devices that have their MAC addresses configured to DHCP server can be alloted a IP or may be denied, if not.

DHCP - can be used to configured a lot of things - IP Addresses, Gateways, NTP (Network time protocol), subnet networks, etc;
- NTP - Network time protocols servers - used to keep all the computers on a network synchronized in time;


* DHCP in Action
---------------------
-> It is an Application layer protocol - relies on the transport, network, data-link and physical layers to operate; 
-> The DHCP is useful to configure the network layer

-> DHCP discovery - The process by which a client configured to use DHCP attempts to get network configuration information;
- It has 4 steps:

1. Server Discovery step - 
   The dhcp client sends a DHCP discover message out onto a network;
   The machine doesn't have an ip nor does it know the ip of the DHCP server - a specially crafted broadcast message is formed instead;
   The  DHCP listens on UDP port 67(client) and DHCP discovery message is sent from UDP port 68 (source).
   The DHCP DISCOVER message is encapsulated in a UDP datagram - destination port - 67, source port - 68; This is encapsulated inside an IP datagram - 
   destination IP of 255.255.255.255 and source IP of 0.0.0.0;
   This broadcast message will get delievered on every node on the local area network and if a DHCP server is present it would receive the message;
- This message is 342 or 576 bytes long   
   
  2. The DHCP server will examine its own configuration and makes a decision on what IP address to offer the client; It checks if it is to run with dynamic, 
     automatic or fixed address allocation;
     Then a DHCP OFFER message will be sent with a destination messgae of port 68 and source port of 67, destination broadcast ip of - 255.255.255.255 and its 
     actual IP as the source;
     This message is also a broadcast it will be received by every machine on the network, and the original client would recognize the message was for itself. 
     Since the DHCP OFFER has a field that specifies the MAC address of the client that sent the DHCP message;
 -  Size of message is 342 bytes. If there are more than one DHCP servers present in the network then client host will accept the first DHCP OFFER message it receives. 
 -  Also a server ID is specified in the packet in order to identify the server.       
  
  3. The client machine will then process the DHCP OFFER message to see what IP address is being offered to it. It would send a DHCP REQUEST Message. 
     (0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255 - since the IPs are not assigned);
  -  The client will produce a gratitutous ARP in order to find if there is any other host present in the network with same IP address. 
     If there is no reply by other host, then there is no host with same TCP configuration in the network and the message is broadcasted to server showing 
     the acceptance of IP address .A Client ID is also added in this message.

  4. The server responds with a DHCP ACK message; (The DHCP server source ip -> 255.255.255.255:68) - client recognized the message by the MAC address 
     encapsulated in it;
  
  5. The client machines networking stack now uses the configuration information  presented to it by the DHCP server to set up its own network layer 
     configuration; 
     This configuration - DHCP Lease - as it includes the expiration time. It might last for days or for a short amount of time; 
     On expiration the DHCP client needs to negotiate a new lease by performing the entire DHCP Discovery process;
     
* DHCP negative acknowledgement message –
  Whenever a DHCP server receives a request for IP address that is invalid according to the scopes that is configured with, it send DHCP Nak message to client.
  Eg-when the server has no IP address unused or the pool is empty, then this message is sent by the server to client. 
  
* DHCP decline –
  If DHCP client determines the offered configuration parameters are different or invalid, it sends DHCP decline message to the server.
  When there is a reply to the gratuitous ARP by any host to the client, the client sends DHCP decline message to the server showing the offered IP address 
  is already in use.  

* DHCP inform –
 If a client address has obtained IP address manually then the client uses a DHCP inform to obtain other local configuration parameters, such as domain name. 
 In reply to the dhcp inform message, DHCP server generates DHCP ack message with local configuration suitable for the client without allocating a new IP address. 
 This DHCP ack message is unicast to the client.
 
- Note – All the messages can be unicast also by dhcp relay agent if the server is present in different network.

- Advantages – The advantages of using DHCP include:

- centralized management of IP addresses
- ease of adding new clients to a network
- reuse of IP addresses reducing the total number of IP addresses that are required
- simple reconfiguration of the IP address space on the DHCP server without needing to reconfigure each client

- Disadvantages – Disadvantage of using DHCP is:

- IP conflict can occur

NAT - Network Address Translation https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/
-----------------------------------
- It is a technique not a standard like - DNS, DHCP, etc;
- NAT could be OS and hardware dependent;

- A technology that allows a gateway usually a router or a firewall to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response;

NAT is hiding the source IP address and masking with its gateway or relevant IP address; This is termed as IP masquerading;

NAT and Transport Layer
-------------------------
- NAT at the network layer is easy but not so at the transport layer;
- one ip is translated into another usually by a router;
- many to one - > many IP address are translated into a single out bound NAT ip;
- the reverse is complicated, the router needs to figure which response correspondce to which compuer; - The simpleast way to do this is via - port preservation;

* Port preservation - a technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router; Outbound comnnections choose ports at random - from the ephemeral ports - 49152 - 65535;

Client                                                                          Destination
------                                              (NAT)                        -------------
source IP - 10.1.1.1000                             Router                    
destination - 10.1.1.100                                                       destination ip : 192.168.1.1
source port - 51300                                                            source port - 51300

- The source port in the TCP datagram remains the same, and the data is stored internally in a table; Then the traffic is forwarded back to the IP 10.1.1.100 on source port - 51300;
- Incase two computers on a network use the same port then the router normally selects an unused port at random instead;

* Port Forwarding -> A technique where specific destination ports can be configured to always be delievered to specific nodes;
- This allows for IP masquerading; 
-> The detination receives the source IP of the router rather than the actual server IP, while the router will route the intended traffic to the source wiythput exposing its IP address;


Web Server                                      Router                                              Client

IP - 10.1.1.5 
         Destination IP - 10.1.1.5                                                       Destination IP - 192.168.1.1
         Port - 80                                                                                port : 80
         10.1.1.0/24
         

Consider a company with Web server (10.1.1.5) and a Mail server (10.1.1.6) -> Through port forwarding on their actual source IPs are never exposed but the routers address is exposed , when the response reached the traffic (same IP/ same DNS) is directed to the intended server based on the destination port;

- IANA - responsible for assigning address blocks to the 5 regional internal registries - RIRs 
    1. AFRINIC - Serves Africa
    2. ARIN - United States, Canada, Parts of Caribbean;
    3. APNIC - Most of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island Nations;
    4. LACNIC - Central and South America, other parts of the Carribean;
    5. RIPE - Europe, Russia, Middle East and portions of Central Asia;
    
IP address spaces are exhausting world-wide. Work arount - NAT (Network Addres Translation) and Non-routable address space;
- RFC1918 - defined non-routable address space;
- With one exposed address space - NAT can internally have multiple non-routable address spaces.
