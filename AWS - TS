1. Troubleshooting: I am not able to connect to the internet. I do not have a spare device with me. Troubleshoot the scenario and figure out where does the issue 
  lie?
Ans. Issue can lie with the device, or the network, or from the server side. This needs to be answered strategically from the most common issue raised first, 
     to the least common possibility addressed last.
     - Maybe it's a DNS problem : See if the website DNS name (let's say it is example.com) resolves to an IP address. You can do this by starting a console or 
       command prompt, and typing ping example.com. If you get an "unknown host" error this means there is likely a DNS problem.
       nslookup google.com
     - Clear browser cache - Maybe it's a browser problem. If it does resolve in DNS, but you don't get ping replies it means they are either filtering pings 
       or you can't reach that site.
     - Maybe it's a problem with your internet connection : Use traceroute example.com, to see where it times out.
       o/p - google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
     - Check router, reset it. Contact ISP.
     
2. I am trying to transfer media over FTP from one device to another. The rate of transfer is very slow. Troubleshoot the scenario.
Ans. Main issue that affects - The number of clients that currently are using the FTP service. Bandwidth allocated.
     - The first test you can do is to perform local FTP speeds. Install client and server on same network and check the speed. - FileZilla. If you have top speed, 
       that means it is not a problem with your application.
     - Letâ€™s Verify the Network. 
        - Ping The Gateway. See RTT value, if greater then you are far away from gateway, could be the reason.
        - Trace the Route Towards the Destination. - if any server is delaying it, then possible may be located far away from server.
     - Use Wired Instead of Wireless.
     - Check Whether you are connected to a VPN or Proxy. 
     - Check your Antivirus. 
        - An Antivirus is the first line of defense against Malware. But despite its many benefits, it can degrade your Internet speed and 
          computer performance. Malware might be the No.1 reason for your slow Internet speed. 
          
3. My device is heating up very quickly. Troubleshoot the scenario.         
Ans. Reason - insufficient cooling.
      Hardware -
     1. Fix Internal Cooling
        The first and most important thing you need to do when your laptop is overheating is to clean the fan(s) that provide(s) cooling to the CPU and graphics
        card. Over time, they build up layers of dust and dirt that slow them down and block airflow.
     2. Keep The Laptop On A Hard And Flat Surface
     3. Invest In A Laptop Cooler Or Cooling Pad.
     
     Software -     
     1. You can either reduce brightness of your screen or reduce the CPU clock speed (The clock speed measures the number of cycles your CPU executes per second)..
     2. Limit start-up apps.
     3. Clean cache.
     4. Using RAM consuming processes for a long time.
