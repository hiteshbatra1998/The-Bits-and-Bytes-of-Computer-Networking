Networking
------------

* Protocol - A defined set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly;
* Computer Networking - Full scope of how computers communicate with each other;

1. Physical Layer
------------------
* Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers, specification, joiner, specifications of the signals sent through, cabling, connectors and sending signals;

2. Data Link Layer / Network Interface / Network Access Layer
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate;
* Many protocols for the Data link layer - most common - Ethernet, although wireless technologies are becoming popular;

- The Ethernet standard - specifyes the physical layer attributes and defines protocols responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link;

- The data link layer is responsible to get data across a single link;

3. Network Layer / Internet Layer
----------------------------------
* Enables different networks to communicate with each other through a devices known as routers;
- A collection of networks connected together through routers is called the Internetwork - Internet;
- The network layer is responsible for getting data delivered across a collection of networks;
- The most common protocol used here is the IP - Internet Protocol; 
- IP is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world;

- The network layer delievers data between two individual nodes;

4. Transport Layer
------------------
* Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data;
- Most common protocol - TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - provides reliability;
- Another protocol - UDP - User Datagram Protocol - does not provide data reliability;

- The Transport Layer (TCP/UDP) - ensures the data on the node gets to the respective application;

5. Application Layer
---------------------
- Many protocols - application specific;
- Protocols allowto browse the web or send receive emails, etc;

* Basics of Networking Devices
------------------------------

1. Cables - Connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them; 
 - 2 types - Copper or fiber, binary data value is sent through these copper cables by changing the voltage and the system at the receiving end is able to interpret these voltage canges and the binary data;
a. The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables; - Cat -> category -             different physical categories like the number of twists, lengths and transfer rates, inteferences, crosstalk;
  - Crosstalk - When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire;
b. Fiber optic cables - Contain individual optical fiber, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair;
  - Pulses of light are used to represent ones and zeros of the data;
  - It is used in places where there is a lot of electromagnetic interfernces;
  - Higher speed, longer distances, no data loss, expensive;
  
  
2. Hubs and Switches
----------------------
* Hub - A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once, it could cause a collision domain;
- Collison domain - a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time, otherwise electrical signal from other systems will interfere, slows;
- Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.  In other words, collision domain of all hosts connected through Hub remains one.  
  Also, they do not have intelligence to find out best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.
  
- Active Hub:- These are the hubs which have their own power supply and can clean, boost and relay the signal along with the network. 
  It serves both as a repeater as well as wiring centre. 
- Passive Hub :- These are the hubs which collect wiring from nodes and power supply from active hub. 
  These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them.
- Intelligent Hub :- It work like active hubs and include remote management capabilities.
  It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.

* Switch is a multiport bridge.
- A Data-link layer device.
- It inspects the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and send it to it; 
- Eliminates collision domain, but broadcast domain remains same.

1.	Hub is operated on Physical layer. -----  While switch is operated on Data link layer.
3.	Hub have maximum 4 ports.          -----  While switch can have 24 to 28 ports.
5.	Hub is a half duplex transmission mode.	-----   While switch is a full duplex transmission mode.
6.	In hub, Packet filtering is not provided. ----- While in switch, Packet filtering is provided.
7.	Hub cannot be used as a repeater. 	  ----- While switch can be used as a repeater.

Bridge – A bridge operates at data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of source 
         and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. 
	 It has a single input and single output port, thus making it a 2 port device.

* Hubs and Switches are the primary devices used to connect computers on a single network , usually referred to as LAN (Local Area Network);

3. Routers
------------
- Router - A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks;
- It operates at the 3rd layer - Network Layer;
- A router detemines the IP address to determine where to send the data;
- Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between lots of different networks in the world;

- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets trhem to learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic;

4. Gateway – A gateway, as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks together that may work upon different networking models. 
	     They basically work as the messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it, and transfer it to another system. 
	     Gateways are also called protocol converters and can operate at any network layer. Gateways are generally more complex than switch or router.
