*  The Network Layer
---------------------

-> In LAN - nodes can communicate with each other through their physical MAC addressses - works well on small scale and switches can learn the MAC addresses connected to each other port to forward transmission;
-> Every single network interface has a unique MAC address and are not ordered in a systematic way, hence no way of knowing the location of MAC address at any point of time - not ideal for communicating long distances;
- The nodes learn about each other through physical addressing that isn't translatable to anything besides a single network signet;
- An alternate solution is the IP;

* IP Addresses
----------------

-> IP addresses are 32-bit long numbers made up of 4 octets, and each octet is described in decimal numbers.
    172.16.254.1   -> 10101100 . 00010000 . 11111110 . 00000001  -> 4 bytes - 32 bits; (0-255) -> Dotted Decimal Notation;

-> IP Addresses are distributed in large sections to various organizations and companies instead of being determined by hardware vendors - IP addresses are more hierarchical and easier to store data than physical addresses;
-> IP addresses belong to networks, not to devices attached to those networks;
-> A Laptop will have the same MAC address whereever it is by an IP address will differ - home network, cafe network, etc, the LAN at a home network or internet cafe will each be individually responsible to handing out an IP address;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) Suppose there are two brothers who are twins. Now, their parents were too damn lazy to think of two different names, so they named both of them “Matt”.
But, while in house it was difficult for them to distinguish between both of them as they had same name. So they named one “Smarty” and another “Pants”. Now these names were only used in the house, hence they become their private names (Private IP). While outside they were still called by their public names “Matt”.
Similarly there can be no two computers connected with the same WiFi to have same private names because it will be difficult to determine that which computer is being called as it creates a state of ambiguity.

2.) In a single line - In a network there can not be more than one host with same IP address, but their public IP can be same.
There are two IP address assigned to each device on a Wi-Fi network. An Internal (Private) and an External (Public) IP address.
Internal IP address is used for communication between Your computer and a smartphone or whatever devices that are connected to that Wifi network. This is unique for each. If they are same the system cannot differentiate between each device.
the External IP address is that visible to the the internet - the websites, the internet connected Apps so on. By default, Routers with NAT (all routers today have it) assign same Public IP address to all devices under its network. 
It looks something like 132.104.54.128. Just google the term My IP from all your tablets and computers connected to same router and you will see the same Public IP address on all of them.
The thing you should be concerned about is your Public IP, as private IP is only considered in internal networks.
Even though the Public IP is same for all device on same WiFi, you can bypass it and get a new IP with the help of a VPN.

3.) IP addresses are globally managed by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) and regional Internet registries(RIR).

4.) While finding the total number of host IP addresses, 2 IP addresses are not counted and are therefore,
    decreased from the total count because the first IP address of any network is the network number and whereas the last IP address is reserved for broadcast IP.

5.) IPv4 vs IPv6
            - IPv4 is 32-Bit IP address whereas IPv6 is a 128-Bit IP address.
            - IPv4 is a numeric addressing method whereas IPv6 is an alphanumeric addressing method.
            - IPv4 binary bits are separated by a dot(.) whereas IPv6 binary bits are separated by a colon(:).
            - IPv4 offers 12 header fields whereas IPv6 offers 8 header fields.
            - IPv4 has checksum fields while IPv6 doesn’t have checksum fields
            - IPv4 uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map to MAC address whereas IPv6 uses NDP (Neighbour Discovery Protocol) to map to MAC address.
            - IPv4 offers five different classes of IP Address from Class A to E whereas lPv6 allows storing an unlimited number of IP Address.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - enables to add a new host to the network, or add an IP addressto a host newly added to the network - this is termed as Dynamic IP Address; The other alternative is Static IP Address(Configured on a node manually);
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks, 
   whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network, 
   so they can communicate with other IP networks. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP),
   reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.
   In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address.
   
-> In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients;

* IP Datagram and Encapsulation
-----------------------------------
- packet of the network layer -> IP Datagram;
- IP datagram - A highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined;
- 2 primary sections of a IP datagram are Header and Payload;

0          4               8             16           19                    31
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Version  | Header Length | Service Type |         Total Length            |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|            Identification               |    Flags   |   Fragment Offset  |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|         TTL              | Protocol     |     Header Checksum             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                               Source IP Address                           |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                               Destination IP Address                      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                         Options                            | Padding      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Version - IPv4, IPv6; 4 - bit
2. Header Length - 4 bit - length of the entire header; (20 bytes len - IPv4 )
3. Service Type - 8 bits - specify the quality of the service - QoS technologies - could also prioritize IP Datagrams;
4. Total Length - 16 bits - Indicate the total length of the IP datagram it's attached to;
5. Identification - 16 bit number used to group messages together;
  The maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number that can be represented with 16 bits; 65,535;
  If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger that what can fit a single datagram, the IP layer needs to split the data   up into many individual packets and the identification number will be the same for the packets to ensure the receiving ends             understands its all a part of the same transaction;
6. Flag - used to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented or to indicate the datagram has been fragmented already;
7. Fragmentation - Process of taking a singlr IP datagram and splitting it up into several smaller datagrams;
8. TTL - Time ot Live - 8 bit, indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away;
   As a datagram hops from one router to another each router decrements the TTL value by 1, and it's forwarded until it reaches 0,          thereafter it is discarded this prevents looping;
9. Protocol - 8 bit, contains data about the transport layer protocol being used - TCP/UDP;
10. Header checksum field - A checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header - ensures the datagram data is not corrumpted       and as the TTL value changes at each router it touches the checksum field value also changes;
11. Source IP Address - 32 bit;
12. Destination IP Address - 32 bit;
13. Options - An optional field and is used to set special characteristics for datagrams primarily for testing purpose;
14. Padding - Series of 0's to ensure the header is the correct total size;

-> Encapsulation -> The entire content of an IP datagram are encapsulated as the payload of an Ethernet frame;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* IP Address Classes
--------------------
-> Ip addresses can be split into 2 sections - network ID and the host ID; 
-> Address Class System - A way of defining how a global IP address space is split up;
-> 3 primary types of address classes 
  * Class A - 1st octet - Network ID, last three are used for Host ID; begin 0 ; 0 - 126  | 16 Million hosts ; 
  * Class B - first two octets - Network ID, second two are used for the Host ID; begins with 10 ; 128 - 191 | 6400 Hosts ; 
  * Class C - first three octets - Network ID, last octet - Host ID; begins with 110 ; 192 - 223 | 254 Hosts ;
  * Class D - Begin with 1110 - used for multicasting - how a single IP datagram can be sent to an entire network at once ; 224 - 239;
  * Class E - Unassigned and used for testing purposes - 240 - 255;
  
-> This class system has been replaced by CIDR (Classless inter-domain routing);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class A -:
        IP address belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts.
        
        The network ID is 8 bits long. The host ID is 24 bits long.
        The higher order bit of the first octet in class A is always set to 0. The remaining 7 bits in first octet are used to determine network ID. The 24 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network. 
        The default subnet mask for class A is 255.x.x.x. Therefore, class A has a total of:

        -> 2^7-2= 126 Number of network ID (Here 2 address is subracted because 0.0.0.0 and 127.x.y.z are special address. ) ( 2 is always subtracted from hosts, but there exists a special case in network of Class A, therefore, it is subtracted here)
        -> 2^24 – 2 = 16,777,214 host ID
        IP addresses belonging to class A ranges from 1.x.x.x – 126.x.x.x
        
Class B -:
        IP address belonging to class B are assigned to the networks that ranges from medium-sized to large-sized networks.

        The network ID is 16 bits long.
        The host ID is 16 bits long.
        The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class B are always set to 10. The remaining 14 bits are used to determine network ID. 
        The 16 bits of host ID is used to determine the host in any network. The default sub-net mask for class B is 255.255.x.x. Class B has a total of:

        -> 2^14 = 16384 network address
        -> 2^16 – 2 = 65534 host address
        IP addresses belonging to class B ranges from 128.0.x.x – 191.255.x.x

Class C -:
        IP address belonging to class C are assigned to small-sized networks.

        The network ID is 24 bits long.
        The host ID is 8 bits long.
        The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class C are always set to 110. The remaining 21 bits are used to determine network ID. 
        The 8 bits of host ID is used to determine the host in any network. The default sub-net mask for class C is 255.255.255.x. Class C has a total of:

        -> 2^21 = 2097152 network address
        -> 2^8 – 2 = 254 host address
        IP addresses belonging to class C ranges from 192.0.0.x – 223.255.255.x
        
Class D -:
        IP address belonging to class D are reserved for multi-casting. The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses belonging to class D are always set to 1110. 
        The remaining bits are for the address that interested hosts recognize.

        Class D does not posses any sub-net mask. IP addresses belonging to class D ranges from 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
        
Class E -:
        IP addresses belonging to class E are reserved for experimental and research purposes. IP addresses of class E ranges from 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.254. This class doesn’t have any sub-net mask. 
        The higher order bits of first octet of class E are always set to 1111.
        
* 127.0.0.0 – 127.0.0.8 : Loop-back addresses
* 0.0.0.0 – 0.0.0.8 : used to communicate within the current network.     

-> Within any network, the host ID must be unique to that network.
-> Host ID in which all bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned because this host ID is used to represent the network ID of the IP address.
-> Host ID in which all bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned because this host ID is reserved as a broadcast address to send packets to all the hosts present on that particular network.

* Because of wastage of number of ip addresses in Classful addressing, we introduced Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR), to solve the issue.
  CIDR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ywmOpWehE&list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGFBD2-2joCpWOLUrDLvVV_&index=36
  Format - w.x.y.z/n ( n = mask, number of consec 1's ). Things we can figure out - Number of hosts, Subnet mask, Network Id.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
-------------------------------------
-> MAC Addresses are used at the Data-link Layer.
-> IP addresses are used at the Network Layer.
-> ARP - A protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with certain IP address;
-> Most network connected devices while retaining local ARP table;
-> ARP table - A list of IP Addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them;

-> The IP datagram once fully formed needs to be encapsulated inside an Ethernet frame, hence the transmitting device needs a destination MAC address to complete the Ethernet frame header;
-> Using the data in the ARP table the destination MAC address is seeked or else the transmitting device sends a broadcast ARP message to the MAC broadcast address which is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF - these are delivered to all computers on a local network and the respective network interface sends a ARP response - that contains the MAC address for the network interface;

-> ARP table entries generally expire after short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted;
