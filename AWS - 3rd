1. Why Amazon?
 - The reason why I’m willing to join Amazon is how well I was treated when I raised a complaint which one wouldn’t be able to see in other e-commerce companies. 
   It maybe a small thing but it was pretty magnificent on how Amazon takes little things seriously and I’m a guy of same trait which motivates me to join the 
   workplace where I feel belonged.
 - I believe in the Amazon's vision of achieving a goal that no one has ever thought of. Taking on every domain of IT sector and succeeding in it.   
 
2. Where do you see yourself in five years?
-  I’d like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in this domain. I’ve had amazing mentors and managers in my past positions, so I’d like to be able to provide 
   similar guidance, potentially taking on a leadership role. I’m motivated by connecting my initiatives to the company’s larger goals and I’m excited by the 
   prospect of getting more experience in that. Fill the bottlenecks that I felt I had during my initial stages.
